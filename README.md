# Cyclist-analysis

Cyclistic Bike Analysis.
This repository contains an analysis of Cyclistic bike usage, comparing the behavior of annual members and casual riders to understand their differences and identify potential strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to gain insights into how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes differently and determine opportunities to encourage casual riders to become annual members. The analysis includes exploring ride counts, trip durations, bike types, and usage patterns.

Installation Instructions:
To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Open the R Markdown file cyclistic_analysis.Rmd in RStudio or any compatible environment.
Install any additional R packages required for the analysis.
Knit the R Markdown file to generate the HTML report.
Usage Guide
The analysis is documented in the cyclistic_analysis.Rmd file, which provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization. Users can follow the code and explanations to understand the findings and reproduce the analysis.

Data Sources:
The analysis uses the Cyclistic bike ride data, which can be obtained from the Google data analytics course on cousera (course 8) or by contacting the data provider. The dataset includes information such as ride dates, trip durations, bike types, and user types.......

File Structure:
cyclistic_analysis.Rmd: R Markdown file containing the analysis code and explanations.
cyclistic_analysis.html: HTML report generated from the R Markdown file.
data/: Directory containing the Cyclistic bike ride data files.
images/: Directory containing images and visualizations generated during the analysis.
Slide/: Containing Presentation to Stakeholders.

Results and Findings:
Annual members showed a preference for electric and classic bikes, while avoiding docked bikes entirely.
Casual riders used docked bikes but with lower frequency.
Docked bikes had the highest mean trip duration and distance.
Annual members utilized bikes more frequently on weekdays, indicating commuting or regular usage patterns.
Opportunities exist to convert casual riders to annual members by enhancing the availability of docked bike stations in strategic locations.

Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the Google data analytics course team for providing the bike ride data and the guidance throughout the project.
